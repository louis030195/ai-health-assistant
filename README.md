Mediar is your personal AI-powered health assistant. It provides daily insights and prompts based on your health data, goals, and lifestyle to help you build healthy habits. 

Mediar uses [Metriport](https://metriport.com) for secure and private access to health data through an open-source, SOC2-audited API.

In addition, Mediar uses [Evervault](https://evervault.com/) to anonymise personal information to the eyes of AI providers.

More data privacy techniques are planned to allow the user maximum comfort.

## Key features

- Connects with your wearables and health apps via Apple Health, Google Fit, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.
- Set a health goal and get personalized prompts based on your progress  
- Send messages, photos, voice notes of what you eat, drink, do, feel, to get tailored recommendations
- Receive daily insights based on your lifestyle, habits and sensor data
- Available on WhatsApp and Telegram

## Principles

- **Privacy by Design** - User data privacy and security is a core principle. We use privacy-preserving techniques like data anonymization and encryption to protect sensitive information. 

- **Software 3.0 Native** - Mediar interfaces are optimized for natural human interaction through conversational language and voice.

- **Empathetic AI** - Mediar is designed to understand users' emotions, perspectives, and needs in order to provide supportive and compassionate assistance. We aim to build AI that can sense, interpret, and respond to human feelings.

- **Transparent AI** - Mediar is Open Source and strives to be transparent about how the AI works, what data it uses, and how it benefits the user. We believe users should understand how the technology impacts them.
