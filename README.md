Aiden is your personal AI-powered health assistant. It provides daily insights and prompts based on your health data, goals, and lifestyle to help you build healthy habits. 

Aiden uses [Metriport](https://metriport.com) for secure and private access to health data through an open-source, SOC2-audited API.

In addition, Aiden uses [Evervault](https://evervault.com/) to anonymise personal information to the eyes of AI providers.

More data privacy techniques are planned to allow the user maximum comfort.
